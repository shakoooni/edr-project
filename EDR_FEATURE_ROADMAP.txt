# Advanced EDR Feature Roadmap

1. Kernel-Level Integration
   - Kernel module for memory scanning and anti-rootkit (detect hidden processes, kernel hooks)
   - eBPF-based stealth monitoring

2. Advanced Stealth
   - In-memory execution (no on-disk agent)
   - Polymorphic process names and binary hashes
   - Hide open file descriptors and memory maps from /proc

3. Resilience & Self-Defense
   - Watchdog process to restart agent if killed
   - Binary self-repair or auto-update (signed updates)
   - Anti-uninstall and anti-tamper hooks

4. Detection & Response
   - Real-time behavioral monitoring (syscall tracing, process tree analysis)
   - Memory anomaly detection using ML
   - Automated response: kill/quarantine process, carve and encrypt memory, alert operator

5. Forensics & Triage
   - Timeline of memory region changes (diff snapshots)
   - Volatile artifact collection (handles, loaded modules, injected code)
   - Secure, ephemeral memory carving (RAM-only)

6. Cross-Platform & Portability
   - Windows/macOS support (native APIs, stealth techniques)
   - ARM/embedded support for IoT/OT/ICS

7. Operational Security
   - Secure, ephemeral configuration (encrypted in memory)
   - Operator authentication for sensitive actions
   - Full audit log with cryptographic integrity

8. Threat Intelligence Integration
   - YARA rules for memory scanning
   - Integration with threat feeds (offline, signed updates)

9. Performance & Reliability
   - Adaptive scanning (dynamic throttling based on system load)
   - Graceful degradation under attack or resource exhaustion

10. Testing & CI
   - Fuzzing, property-based testing, and continuous integration for all crates
   - Red team/blue team simulation modules for validation
